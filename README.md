# Sandbox
This repo serves as a testing ground for various languages. I really enjoy learning new languages and different approaches to solving problems.

The programmes here are written for fun and to track progress as I pick up new languages and see what sticks. Some of these may break, some are repeated, and some may grow to form bigger projects eventually -- but mostly they're written to get to grips with syntax.

## Languages
This started as a place to hold Lua code but has since expanded to Fennel, D, Zig, and more on the horizon. Nim is the latest language I'm looking at. It looks interesting so far! It feels like a better Python with optional static typing.
