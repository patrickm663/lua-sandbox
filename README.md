# lua-sandbox
A place to hold simple Lua scripts, written for fun.

Lua has proven to be a fun language for scripting and solving math problems. Its syntax is very simple (it's said that it can fit on the back of a postcard) and fast. I have not yet tested out libraries beyond a first stab at Löve, but I look forward to trying it out again.

My original intentions were to know enough to customise Conky and Neovim. It turns out I like the language enough to programme in it, so I've worked through some programming and math exercises, contained here. I do want to move on to a more ambitious project like the Conky repo I've got sitting, or a Löve game. 

Fennel on the otherhand is a Lisp variant that marries Lisp with Fennel. Having never used Lisp before, Fennel seemed like a good entrypoint since Lua has been good thus far.
